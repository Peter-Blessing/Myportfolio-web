            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is <a href="pics.html" class="navicon">Peter Blessing</a> and I'm an Cyber Security student. I love to express myself through words and explore the world through stories. Writing has always been a passion of mine since the time I was in grade school, and it's something that I've grown to enjoy even more as I've gotten older.
                I'm currently attending college, where I'm majoring in Cyber Security with a focus on programing. When I'm not studying or working on my classes, you can usually find me practicing programing at the library , playing basketball with friends, or curled up somewhere quiet reading my favorite novelists.
                In addition to being passionate about programing, I'm also very interested in psychology and personal development. Understanding how the mind works, and how to effectively communicate with people has become a major interest of mine over the years. In my spare time, I like to attend seminars and read books related to this topic so that I can continue learning new things.
                Overall, I'm a very curious person who loves spending time exploring the world around me. Whether it's through reading or writing, conversation or observation - there is always something new and interesting for me to discover. And as long as I keep learning, I know that all of these experiences will help shape who I am going to be in the future.</p>
